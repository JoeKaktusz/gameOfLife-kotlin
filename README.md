This is a mouse based game and it is not optimized for trackpads.

- You can click on buttons at the top left corner. 
- You can change the time that has to pass between 2 iterations. 
- You can start/stop and clear the simulation. 
- You can zoom in/out with the scroll wheel (which is not optimized for track pad zooming).
- You can hold down right click and move the mouse around which will move around the camero simulation world on the screen (This one is not optimized for trackpad users either).
